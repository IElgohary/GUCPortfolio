# GUCPortfolio

My submission for the "Software Engineering Course" mini project.

# Project Requirements

You are asked to develop a department portfolio for final year MET and BI students.
Each student will be able to register to this website and create a portfolio. A portfolio contains the student name, profile picture and several works by the student. Works can be screenshots, links to websites or code repositories. A client visiting the portfolio will view summary of student portfolios and can then choose to view the detailed portfolio of one student.
